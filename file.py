This chat contains information on H-1B, outsourcing, and remote work opportunities.

User: what H1B and what is the new rules i want simplified english
Assistant: The H-1B visa is a program that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialized roles that require higher education or expertise, like software engineers. The new rules aim to limit outsourcing and encourage more direct hiring for specialized roles.

User: so is it good or bad
Assistant: Whether the new H-1B rules are good or bad depends on your perspective. Here's a simple breakdown...

User: does this affect outsourcing
Assistant: Yes, the new H-1B rules affect outsourcing, particularly for companies that rely on third-party contractors. The changes make it more difficult for outsourcing firms to bring in H-1B workers.

User: so if i want to work with a usa company as a software engineer from morocco it will not be possible anymore
Assistant: Not at all! Itâ€™s still very possible to work with a U.S. company as a software engineer from Morocco, whether remotely or on an H-1B visa.

User: how can i find the job the hire from outside us
Assistant: Here are steps to help you find a U.S. company that hires internationally or sponsors H-1B visas. Start with remote job boards, apply to H-1B sponsoring companies, build a strong online presence, and network actively.

User: what else should i knwo
Assistant: Here are a few important things to consider if you want to work for a U.S. company from Morocco, whether remotely or via an H-1B visa: understand U.S. work visas, salary expectations, time zones, taxes, and how to network effectively.

User: I feel bad because this kinda means that even if I am self learning and getting certifications (from my own money btw) that I'm always going to be passed over by some overseas contractor. I wish this country wouldn't let investors just say faq it and ship all our resources overseas so they could get a bigger payout. This is a comment I read on reddit about this what does it mean
Assistant: This comment expresses frustration about outsourcing and global hiring trends, especially the feeling that U.S. workers are overlooked in favor of cheaper overseas labor, including through the H-1B visa program.

User: what does it do with h1b
Assistant: The comment connects to the H-1B visa because it reflects frustration with global hiring, where some workers feel U.S. companies prefer cheaper foreign labor, including H-1B workers, over local talent. This can create a sense of competition and unfairness.
